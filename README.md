# Budget-Manager

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Difficulty: Easy-Intermediate

This mini-project is from "Beginner's Step-by-Step Coding Course", written by DK Pub. This is a continuation of my career in software development and programming, following my graduation and certification from UC Berkeley's Data Analytics Extension Program. I felt that this project can help hone some of the fundamentals of programming in Python.

"Managing Money can be a tedious task, but it can be made easier with a computer." This product of this project will be a functioning budget manager application using Python. The emphasis of this project is to gain a deeper understanding and become more comfortable with with Python dictionaries and classes.
